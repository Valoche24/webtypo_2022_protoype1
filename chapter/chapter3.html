        <h1>The orientation of the front</h1>

        <p class="txt-01">In figure 3.1 the directions of the strokes differ but the orien­tation of their counterpoints is the same. The orientation of their counterpoints is the orientation of their frontlines.</p>

        <p class="txt-03">The direction of the front is perpendicular to the frontline. The direction of the stroke is consequently not the direction of the front: in figure 3.2 the direction of the stroke at its ends is perpendicular to the direction of the front. In this case the front is stationary while the stroke advances. The movement of the stroke does not necessarily coincide with the move­ment of the front. (The speed of the front is the speed of the stroke multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the di­ rection of the front and the direction of the stroke. In figure 3.1 this angle is a.) At the end of the stroke the pen is lifted and positioned for the following stroke, bringing with it a new front (figure 3.3)</p>

        <p class="txt-04">The stroke of figure 3.4 bends in the direction of the front­line. The front comes to a full stop. However the stroke bends further and the front is set in motion again, now in the op­posite direction.</p>

        <p class="txt-05">In figure 3.5 the stroke doubles back abruptly. In the let­ter in figure 3.6 the front moves forward and returns. As long as the stroke involves no rotation the front sweeps across an area bounded by parallel lines (translation of the frontline). When rotation is a factor, the front fans out.</p>

        <p class="txt-06">In principle, there are two possibilities: for all the strokes of a script, the front either moves in a single direction (this I call an <em>interrupted construction</em>), or there are strokes in which the front reverses its direction and turns back (this I call a <em>re­turning construction</em>).</p>

        <p class="txt-07">In handwriting a stroke in which the writer draws the front toward his hand is called a <em>downstroke</em> and the portion of a stroke that has the front returning is called an upstroke. Out­side handwriting there are no downstrokes or upstrokes, but usually it is possible to make use of these terms as a manner of speaking. Interrupted construction is, then, a construc­tion (or writing style) that consists only ofdownstrokes, and a returning construction hasjoining upstrokes between the downstrokes. In a computer program the direction of the front would however have to be identified because the com­puter cannot come up with a representation of a hand that makes downstrokes and upstrokes.</p>

        <p class="txt-08">The frontline in figure 3.7 marks the ends of all the strokes. The strokes whose fronts move in direction <em>a</em> are the down­strokes, the strokes whose fronts move in direction <em>b</em> are the upstrokes.</p>

        <p class="txt-09">Every culture knows an interrupted construction (figure 3.8) as well as a returning construction (figure 3.9). In Japa­nese writing, for example, <em>kaisho</em> is the interrupted and <em>gyousho</em> the returning construction. This is due, not to a se­cret plot, but to irreconcilable human ideals. A returning construction can be written more quickly (with a 'running' hand) than an interrupted construction, but with an inter­rupted construction it is easier to maintain control. More­over, there are combinations of material and equipment that do not accommodate the making of upstrokes. In returning construction the <em>articulation</em> of the letterform can be sacri­ficed to the <em>speed</em> of execution. Articulation and speed are antipodes in the development of writing. Returning con­struction is characteristic of informal writing, although a returning construction can also be paired with marked ar­ticulation.</p>

        <p class="txt-10">With excessive speed a returning construction annihi­lates itself. In figure 3.10 the front has no time to turn back. The upstroke has degenerated into a sideways shift of the stroke, after which the movement of the front is resumed. This rapid writing is cultivated in the running hand of the Netherlandic mannerists. Any faster and the front does not come to a halt, and all that remains of the writing is an un­dulating line.</p>

        <p class="txt-11">In western writing the roman is the current representa­tive of an interrupted construction (figure 3.8). Opposite the roman stands the cursive (figure 3.9). The cursive is a de­scendant of the returning construction but the formal (ar­ticulated) form of the cursive is often interrupted. The re­turning and the interrupted cursive differ in the linking of their stems. If in returning construction a linking upstroke runs from thick to thin (figure 3.n), then the comparable link runs from thin to thick in interrupted construction (figure 3.12), and vice versa.</p>

        <p class="txt-12">Returning construction is the most important force in the development of writing, but increased speed or marked ar­ticulation can be its undoing.</p>
